# Safari - A trip to the wild

> Safari [noun], Plural sa·fa·ris. An overland journey to observe wild animals

Since I started working as a web developer, there hasn't been anything close to the excitement of force-quitting the Safari browser after a tedious and frustrating late-night debugging session.

The feeling of relief when your web application finally works as expected with the possibility that it might now work again for at least the next two weeks is just priceless.

Yes, we are living in the year 2024, Elon Musk has still not 
arrived on Mars, and Safari is still the browser that makes developers' lives miserable. But why is that?
