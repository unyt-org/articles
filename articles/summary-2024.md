# The Year 2024 – unyt.org Looks Back

2024 has been a remarkable year for our young association. It is the first full year
to have passed since its formation in late 2023. We went from virtually nothing to quite
some small achievements with astonishingly praising feedback along the way.

Here are a few select highlights which we like to look back upon:

## Big Developer Experience Improvements

Our flagship technologies UIX and DATEX are currently used in state education
at Technical University Berlin. This, however, imposed the requirement to provide
support to students for these new and experimental tools. Sleepless nights of bug-fixing,
documentation enhancements and Q&A Forum attendance eventually culminated in a decision that
was long overdue but would cause even more work: the **Developer Experience Initiative**.

Not only were the docs further updated and even more bugs fixed, but major parts of our tools have also
been redesigned to provide developers the carefree experience we promised them. This includes
a fully custom Deno Runtime fork which makes the new [simplified JUSIX reactivity syntax](https://github.com/unyt-org/jusix) possible.

We won't stop here, though. For 2025, an all-new implementation of DATEX in Rust is planned and
already in the makings. Together with the first formal iteration of the DATEX Protocol Specification,
this reference implementation will become the stable, performant and reliable backbone of the next
generation of UIX.

## Featured in The New Stack

In June, an author of the online magazine [The New Stack](https://thenewstack.io) approached us for 
an [article on our full-stack framework UIX](https://thenewstack.io/uix-a-full-stack-web-dev-framework-leveraging-deno).
It turned out quite well and brought some interested people to our GitHub.
We're thankful for this opportunity!

## Successful StartupSÜD Pitch

The [StartupSÜD Summit](https://startupsued.de/summit/) on October 10th was a lot of fun. While unyt.org is not a startup – and not commercially
oriented for sure – it's still worth it to present our technologies at startup events. Tech
founders tend to be open to modern solutions and can benefit from the fast development
cycles that our framework imposes. This assumption was validated at the StartupSÜD Summit
where we had a prominently placed pavillion right at the entrance that continuously
hosted interesting talks between aspiring tech entrepreneurs and us.

## Featured on YouTube

In December, German Tech YouTuber [Loris Galler](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller) called us up to
get some advice for a [new video](https://youtu.be/b7fJfbItzdM?si=RPvp_r3Qs3RZLkGH) he wanted to create
about UIX and DATEX – technologies which he named to be "game changers" for modern web development.
His style is very diverting, studded with silly jokes and absurdly manages to be informative all
the while. If you happen to understand the German language, a [subscription to his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller?sub_confirmation=1)
is a must.

## Outlook for 2025

It's out of question that we will continue to stay in touch with the public through various channels and
news media. The next big milestone will be to finish the DATEX Rust Core to propel our core protocol
out of the experimental and into an "alpha" phase. Then, we will be able to iterate up to release
candidates until we start rolling out our final releases which will then be attested to be stable
and reliable, no matter the use case and environmental conditions.

As it is our mission to also bring support and education to web-interested people, we will also host
the first UIX Hackathon in 2025. We are currently planning all the aspects that are involved in organizing
a major gathering like this.

Exciting times ahead, stay tuned!
