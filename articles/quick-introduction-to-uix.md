# A quick introduction to UIX

[UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix), an open-source framework, isn't just an upgrade—it’s a complete evolution of how we think about full-stack development. With UIX 0.3, reactivity is automatic and seamless. Imagine building web apps where everything reacts dynamically without complex boilerplate. That’s what UIX brings to the table. ✨

If you haven’t tried UIX yet, you might want to consider it. Why? It combines front-end and back-end development into one cohesive experience, reducing the need for juggling multiple tools like REST APIs, Webpack, and SQL separately. Let’s dive in and see how UIX compares to traditional frameworks and why it’s a game-changer!
